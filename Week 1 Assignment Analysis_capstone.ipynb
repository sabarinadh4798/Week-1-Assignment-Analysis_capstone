    "As Alex is planning to open a restaurant in Alexanderplatz, and assuming that she is going to rent a place. So first I took the rent dataset from (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) according to neighborhood wise, so that it's easy for us to check the rent data neighborhood wise. In this dataset I couldn't get all neighborhoods rent information. So I managed to use only those information which I could get from the website. I have cleaned the dataset and I'm going to compare the rent data of only year 2018. Because for this project we just need to analyse the current rent range."
